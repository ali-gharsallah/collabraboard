Some notes:

	o Clutter for user interface (buttons, etc): 
		* clutter-project.org
		* http://www.openismus.com/documents/clutter_tutorial/0.8/docs/tutorial/html/index.html
		* 2.5D rendering, intended to make rich graphical interfaces easy. Hardware accelerated where possible (OpenGL / OpenGL ES). Cairo rendering onto clutter textures possible (and in fact easy).

	o Cairo for rendering of actual "whiteboard"
	 	* http://www.cairographics.org/manual/
		* Vector drawing library, can read and write SVG, PNG, can write to PDF. Potentially very useful.

	o GStreamer / libwebcam for video streaming / webcam support?
		* Search google for more info

Test.cpp has a current program I'm using to just go through tutorials and learn the various APIs.
